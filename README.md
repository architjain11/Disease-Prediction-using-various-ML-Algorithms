# Disease Prediction by Juxtaposition of Multiple Machine Learning Models
The field of healthcare has a vast application of machine learning in this era Traditional ways of diagnosing a disease can only consider a limited number of factors, but with the upcoming technologies, we can consider thousands of factors in the matter of seconds. Machine learning helps in making data-driven decisions relating to key trend and driving research efficiency. We find the highest accuracy of prediction in case of multilayer perceptron with ReLU activation.
